# kind cluster ( Multi-node )

# using the command line, but we need to go to the kind of documentation -> click the configuration button -> copy code

1. vim multi-node-k8s-cluster.yaml 

kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
# One control plane node and three "workers".
#
# While these will not add more real compute capacity and
# have limited isolation, this can be useful for testing
# rolling updates etc.
#
# The API-server and other control plane components will be
# on the control-plane node.
#
# You probably don't need this unless you are testing Kubernetes itself.

# master + 4 worker nodes
nodes:
- role: control-plane
- role: control-plane
- role: worker
- role: worker
- role: worker
- role: worker
2. kind create cluster --name 6-node-cluster --config=multi-node-k8s-cluster.yaml
2 kubectl get pods -w
